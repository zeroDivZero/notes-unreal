# LEVEL vs MAP

**Level** is the official term for collection of assets and playable space within editor.

But often used interchangeably with **map**. Though **map** may refer more specifically to `.umap` file that contains level's data.

In Content Drawer, ones with yellow lines (double-click to open):

## Create New Level

Create folder `Levels` under `Content` if not done.

`File` &rarr; `New Level`. Save it in that folder.

## Default Levels

`Edit` &rarr; `Project Settings`. Then on left under `Projects`, select `Maps & Modes`. On right under `Default Maps`, can set `Editor Startup Map` and `Game Default Map`:
