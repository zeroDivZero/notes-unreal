# NAVIGATE VIEWPORT

![Scene](/assets/UnrealEditor/UnrealEditor-Scene.png)

Hold down **Left** mouse button and move mouse to navigate in scene. But easier to hold down **Right** mouse button to look around and use **WASD** to move (**QE** to move vertically). Use mouse **Wheel** to zoom.

If lost, double-click any **actor** in **Outliner** (see [Move and Place Actors](./2_move_and_place_actors.md)) to zoom in viewport to that actor.
